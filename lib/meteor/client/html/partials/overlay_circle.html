    <p>OVR services are designed to help students to attain skills,
    resources, attitudes, and expectations needed to compete in the
    interview process, get a job, and keep a job. These services can
    be performed in a variety of settings, and are of particular
    importance during the transition phase between high school and
    post-secondary options.</p>
